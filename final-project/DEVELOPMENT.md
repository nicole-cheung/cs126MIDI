# Development
### Week 0
* Generated oF project
* ofxMidi provides examples for testing - tested outputs and inputs
* Output explore - get an idea for what types of data are stored in each MIDI note
* Input explore - going to try to treat this like istream to load MIDI files

### Week 1
* Created note structure to store MIDI data 
* Started initial creation of data/methods needed to store graphics info
* Fiddled with setup() to get initial app going
* Most of my time was spent trying to interpret documentation in the ofxMidi files
* Wrote new message function to receive new note inputs - here, I decided to begin with a non-significant but still visually responsive circular display
