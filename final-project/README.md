# MIDI Visualizer
This app takes MIDI inputs and creates a simple but dynamic visual response that can be screencast and recorded for video purposes or to teach basic music principles such as pitch change and note length. Note: This program DOES NOT create its own audio due to most MIDI devices' ability to create their own audio! For demo purposes, sending your MIDI output to both MIDI Visualizer and another audio program (such as Garageband for Mac) will run smoothly.

### Things needed for setup/development
* A MIDI input - this can be a keyboard, separate software that can send MIDI outputs, or any other device
* openFrameworks and the ofxMidi addon

### Future Development
The complexity of a MIDI file/structure and its interaction with outside devices largely slowed the addition of features to this app. In the future, possible additions could be the ability for users to change color gradient, graphic quality, and in-app recording features.
