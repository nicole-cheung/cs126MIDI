# Project Proposal
### Summary
MIDI files are typically used by music students to self-teach songs on the piano. Additionally, it is an easy way to visualize music in regards to pitch and note length for a multitude of different reasons both educationally, recreationally, and as assistive technology for those who are hard-of-hearing/deaf. I want to create an app that takes MIDI files and creates graphically interesting displays that respond to note changes in the music.

### openFrameworks
* ofxMidi found here: https://github.com/danomatika/ofxMidi || Purpose: analyze and import MIDI files - particularly, ofxMidiClock can analyze tempo and ofxMidiMessage analyzes pitch
* ofPath || If I decide to create graphics that react to pitch, ofPath can draw lines/shapes that react to higher pitches. This would be particularly usefull for music theory to study melodic lines.
